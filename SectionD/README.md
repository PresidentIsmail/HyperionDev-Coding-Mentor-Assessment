## Option 1: Student Progress

### Intervention Plan for Student Progress

To create an effective intervention plan for the given scenario, I would follow these steps:

1. **Assessment and Prioritization**:

   - Review the curriculum and tasks for the bootcamp to understand the specific areas where the lagging students are struggling.
   - Identify the tasks that the at-risk students need to complete in the next 2 days to avoid falling behind.
   - Determine the tasks that the advanced students have completed or are currently working on.

2. **Communication and Support**:

   - Reach out to the 5 lagging students individually to understand their challenges and reasons for falling behind.
   - Provide personalized support to address their concerns and offer additional resources, such as extra study materials or one-on-one sessions.
   - Encourage the at-risk students to prioritize and complete their upcoming tasks within the next 2 days by sending reminders and offering assistance if needed.

3. **Task Breakdown and Time Management**:

   - Break down the remaining tasks for the lagging students into smaller, manageable steps.
   - Help the students create a detailed study plan with specific goals and deadlines for each task.
   - Assist the at-risk students in organizing their time effectively to complete the tasks within the given 2-day timeframe.

4. **Regular Check-ins and Monitoring**:

   - Schedule regular check-in sessions with the lagging and at-risk students to track their progress and address any issues.
   - Monitor their task completion and provide timely feedback and guidance.

5. **Flexibility and Adaptability**:
   - Recognize that each student's situation is unique, and adjust the intervention plan based on their individual needs.
   - Stay open to feedback from students and be prepared to make adjustments as necessary.

### Goal:

The intervention plan aims to:

- Assist lagging students in catching up on missed progress.
- Support at-risk students to complete imminent tasks.
- Ensure advanced students continue progressing without disruption.

Through individualized support, effective time management, collaboration, and regular check-ins, the plan fosters a positive learning environment and ensures the successful progression of all students in the bootcamp.

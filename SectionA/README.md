**File: anagram.py**

```python
# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.
# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of
# a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
# You can return the answer in any order.
# Strings consist of lowercase English letters.
# Example input: strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
# Expected output: [["bat"], ["nat", "tan"], ["ate", "eat", "tea"]]

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs):
        result = {}
        for s in strs:
            x = "".join(sorted(s))
            if x in result:
                result[x].append(s)
            else:
                result[x] = [s]
        return list(result.values())

ob1 = Solution()
print(ob1.groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
```

### Review

The code attempts to solve the anagram grouping problem using a Python class named Solution. The method groupAnagrams within the class iterates through the input array of strings and uses a dictionary to group anagrams. The logic for sorting characters and using a dictionary to store anagrams is a valid approach.

However, there are areas for improvement in terms of code clarity, and documentation:

1. **Correctness**:
   The core logic of grouping anagrams appears to be correct, and the provided example input demonstrates successful grouping.

2. **Style**:
   - The code could benefit from improved variable naming for clarity. The variable x is used to store the sorted string, which could be named more descriptively.  For instance, instead of using 'x', a more expressive variable name like 'sorted_string' could improve readability.

3. **Documentation**:
   - While the example input and output are provided, the code lacks comprehensive comments or explanations. Adding inline comments to clarify each step and explaining the overall approach would enhance code readability.

### Positive Aspects:

- Consider using a more descriptive variable name than x for the sorted string.
- Add comments to explain the steps within the groupAnagrams method for better code understanding.


### Encouragement:

Great job on tackling the anagram grouping problem! Your use of dictionaries and sorting logic shows promise. Consider refining the code for improved readability. Remember to provide clear explanations through comments to make your code more accessible to others.
